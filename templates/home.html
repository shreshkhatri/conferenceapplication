        Industry 5.0 goes beyond automation for goods and services. It put well-being of society at the centre
        of
        automation process to ensure robots and human work collaboratively using cognitive computing
        capabilities with
        human touch. The future Internet technologies, platforms and frameworks are expected to have a
        breakthrough by
        enabling the emergence of Human-centred Cognitive Systems (HCCS) for industry 5.0 application scenarios.
        The
        adaptive, interactive and contextual features are considered as part of the design to adopt
        human-centric
        approaches for such HCCS frameworks. It calls for collaborative and transdisciplinary research to propose
        systems
        with the ability to analyze and predict both human as well as machine behaviours. It proactively
        diagnoses
        issues and recommends solutions without requiring any human intervention.
        <br>
        The annual international conference on Human-centred Cognitive Systems (HCCS) is a flagship
        conference
        to drive innovation for future industry 5.0 application scenarios. The HCCS calls for original
        papers and
        proposals to cover a variety of Human-centred Cognitive Systems stretched across city infrastructures,
        manufacturing, retail, business, tourism, health, law, and education. <BR>The paper submissions are invited on topics  that may include, but are not limited to:
