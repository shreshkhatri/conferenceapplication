            <p class="h6">Workshop Selection</p>
            <p>
                We aim to select a diverse set of workshops and avoid having multiple workshops on overlapping themes.
                Organisers of selected workshops will be asked to produce a Call for Papers to describe the workshop to
                potential participants and solicit submissions. In order to promote vivid discussions with more
                participants to the workshops, HCCS will provide Workshop Organisers with one free registration to the
                Workshop for each 10 papers submitted to their workshop.
                <br><br>The criteria for assessment will include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Relevance to conference vision/topics and attendees
                </li>
                <li>
                    Potential to bring in participants to the conference from different audiences
                </li>
                <li>
                    Overall quality of contribution
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provides a hands-on, collaborative, and/or active learning environment for attendees
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h6">Workshop publication</p>
            <p>
                Accepted and presented papers will be published alongside the main conference proceedings as a
                sub-section/chapter. Paper formats should, therefore, correspond to the templates of the publisher of
                the main conference.
                Workshop chairs are invited to engage journals and further publication opportunities.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h6">Proposal submission</p>
            <p>
                Workshop proposals should be submitted in a maximum of 4 pages in PDF format, single-spaced.<br>
                Please email your workshop proposals to <a href="mailto:gaohonghao@shu.edu.cn">gaohonghao@shu.edu.cn</a> with cc to <a href="mailto:m.iqbal@lsbu.ac.uk">m.iqbal@lsbu.ac.uk</a>
